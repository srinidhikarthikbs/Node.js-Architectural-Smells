## Installation

npm install npm-gui

or

npm install -g npm-gui

How to use

Open terminal and go to folder with package.json file and type npm-gui (if installed globally) or ./node_modules/npm-gui/bin/npm-gui (if installed locally). Now you should be able to open GUI in your browser - navigate to http://localhost:1337/

If you need to start server on another host, port, you should add host:port argument to command, example:

npm-gui localhost:9000

Welcome

npm-gui is a GUI tool for NodeJS based projects. The main key is to easily work with package.json and node_modules folder. Even developers who aren't familiar with task runner like Gulp and GruntJS won't have any problems. For now npm-gui contain a few modules:

    dependencies manager for:
        regular packages
        development packages
    tasks manager
    command builder (based on npm packages)
    console based on websocket communication

How it works

npm-gui is starting simple webserver from folder of your project. Webserver is a core, for example it:

    serve GUI for browser (it is available by default on: http://localhost:1337/)
    modify package.json
    run commands from client side application (example: "npm install angular --save" when you want to add angular to your project)
    pushing console logs through websocket to client side application

Dependencies features

    shows all types of versions:
        saved in package.json,
        installed (if is different - you can save it in package.json)
        wanted (newest compatible version - you can install it and save by click)
        latest
    checks nsp errors (nodesecurity.io) - currently works only for regular dependencies

Another task runner?

No it's not another task runner, package manager etc. It's based on native npm mechanism to install/uninstall/search packages.
