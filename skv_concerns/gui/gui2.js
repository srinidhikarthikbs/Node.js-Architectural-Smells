NW.js (formerly node-webkit)

You can write desktop apps using websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) while retaining access to all Node.JS features and APIs.

Quoting its readme on GitHub:

    NW.js is an app runtime based on Chromium and node.js . You can write native apps in HTML and JavaScript with NW.js. It also lets you call Node.js modules directly from the DOM and enables a new way of writing native applications with all Web technologies.

Features (also quoting from the readme):

        Apps written in modern HTML5, CSS3, JS and WebGL.
        Complete support for Node.js APIs and all its third party modules.
        Good performance: Node and WebKit runs in the same thread: Function calls are made straightforward; objects are in the same heap and can just reference each other;
        Easy to package and distribute apps.
